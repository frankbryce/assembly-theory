Working on algorithm to find complexity of strings by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_theory

Using this algorithm, I discovered there are many assembly paths for abracadabra of index 7.

Feel free to pass in strings of your own, or send pull requests! Example outputs below.

```bash
$ python3 assembly.py
print all min assembly paths for 'abracadabra'

## Dependencies

This isn't a super involved repo (yet), but I do put the modest dependencies in a requirements.txt file

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
